## üß† System Execution Algorithm

### üö¶ General Flow
```python
def warehouse_operation_cycle():
    while True:
        task = get_task_from_wms()

        if task["type"] == "store":
            go_to_pickup_location(task)
            identify_and_pick_item(task)
            go_to_shelf_location(task)
            store_item_in_shelf(task)

        elif task["type"] == "retrieve":
            go_to_shelf_location(task)
            identify_and_pick_item(task)
            go_to_delivery_area(task)
            drop_off_item(task)

        update_inventory_database(task)
        return_to_idle_station_or_next_task()

```

## ü™ú Detailed Operational Steps

### üì• 1. Task Reception
- The robot connects to the WMS (Warehouse Management System).
- It receives specific tasks such as:
  - `store`: place item in a defined shelf
  - `retrieve`: fetch item from storage
  - `inventory_audit`: scan and verify shelf contents
- Task payload includes: `item_id`, `pickup_location`, `target_shelf`, and `priority_level`.

---

### üó∫Ô∏è 2. Autonomous Navigation
- Robot uses **LiDAR + SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**.
- Calculates the optimal path to the target location while avoiding:
  - Static obstacles (walls, shelves)
  - Dynamic obstacles (humans, other robots)
- Continuously updates its internal map using ROS2 `nav2` stack.

---

### üß† 3. Shelf & Item Detection
- Upon reaching a location, the vision system activates:
  - Scans the area using an **RGB-D camera**.
  - Identifies the item using barcode or RFID tag.
  - Detects the item‚Äôs position and orientation.
- Validates the scanned item ID against the WMS.

---

### ‚úã 4. Grasping & Handling
- Executes inverse kinematics to calculate arm movement.
- Aligns the gripper to the detected object coordinates.
- Uses smart gripper with pressure sensors to:
  - Adjust force based on object fragility.
  - Ensure secure grip without damaging the item.
- Lifts the object and transitions to next movement phase.

---

### üì¶ 5. Placement or Delivery
- If storing:
  - Navigates to shelf coordinates.
  - Places item into appropriate slot using depth sensing.
- If retrieving:
  - Carries item to the delivery or packaging area.
- Uses a downward camera to validate precise placement.

---

### üßÆ 6. Inventory Update
- After placement or retrieval, robot sends real-time update to the WMS.
- Information includes:
  - `item_id`
  - `new_location` or `status`
  - `timestamp`
  - `operation_type`
- If errors occur (e.g., item missing, ID mismatch), logs are created and alerts sent.

---

### üîã 7. Battery Management
- Constant battery monitoring via internal battery management system (BMS).
- When battery drops below threshold (e.g., 20%), robot:
  - Completes current task (if safe).
  - Navigates to docking station.
  - Initiates wireless or contact-based charging.
- Charging status also reported to the fleet management dashboard.

---

## üîê Safety & Redundancy Systems

- **Obstacle Avoidance**:
  - Real-time LiDAR + ultrasonic sensors for 360¬∞ detection.
- **Emergency Protocols**:
  - Manual stop button on body
  - Remote stop command via dashboard
- **Environmental Monitoring**:
  - Sensors for temperature, humidity, smoke
  - Alerts if food safety conditions are breached
- **Failover Systems**:
  - Local task caching in case of network/WMS outage
  - Battery health diagnostics and safe-mode behavior
